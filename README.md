# Efficient Road Trip Optimization in Pakistan
This project implements the A* search algorithm to compute optimal paths between cities in Pakistan.

# Project Overview
This Jupyter Notebook utilizes Python and the matplotlib library to:
- Represent the road network of a specific area in Pakistan as a graph.
- Implement the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path between two cities.
- Visualize the optimal path on the graph using matplotlib.

# Technologies Used
-Python
-Jupyter Notebook
-matplotlib

# Usage
Clone this repository or download the Jupyter Notebook file.
Open the Jupyter Notebook in your Jupyter Notebook environment.
Ensure you have the required libraries (matplotlib & heapq) installed. You can install them using pip install matplotlib heapq in your terminal.
Run the notebook cells to execute the code and visualize the results.

Note: This project uses a specific dataset representing a limited area of Pakistan's road network. You may need to modify the code to work with a different dataset or a larger network.

# Additional Information
The A* search algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm that combines a heuristic function with Dijkstra's algorithm to find the most efficient path between two points.
The heuristic function used in this project estimates the straight-line distance between cities.

# Future Work
This project can be extended to encompass a larger and more comprehensive road network of Pakistan.
Different heuristic functions can be explored to potentially improve the efficiency of the algorithm.
The project could be integrated with a map visualization library to display the optimal path on a real map.
